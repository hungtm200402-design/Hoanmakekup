# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root. It points at one context file per project area. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/context/frontend.md`** for customer-facing frontend concepts and workflows.
- **`docs/context/backend.md`** for backend/admin concepts and workflows.
- **`docs/adr/`** for system-wide architectural decisions that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates or updates them when terms or decisions get resolved.

## File structure

This repo uses a multi-context layout:

```text
/
├── CONTEXT-MAP.md
├── docs/
│   ├── context/
│   │   ├── frontend.md
│   │   └── backend.md
│   └── adr/
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in the relevant context file. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use, or there's a real gap to note for `/domain-modeling`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders) - but worth reopening because..._
